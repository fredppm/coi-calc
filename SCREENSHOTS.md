## üìê Technical Requirements

### **Resolution & Format**
- **Format**: PNG (for transparency)
- **Width**: 1200-1400px (for good detail)
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp text
- **Compression**: Optimize for web (but keep readable)

### **Browser Setup**
- **Zoom**: 100% (no browser zoom)
- **Window**: Full screen or large window
- **Theme**: Use default light theme
- **Cursor**: Hide cursor if possible (or position nicely)

### **Content Guidelines**
- **Clean interface**: No debug panels or development tools
- **Good examples**: Use realistic, useful production chains
- **Clear text**: All text should be readable
- **No personal info**: Avoid any personal URLs or data

## üé® Visual Tips

### **Composition**
- **Center important elements**: Main content in focus
- **Leave whitespace**: Don't cram everything together
- **Show context**: Include enough UI to understand the feature

### **Content Ideas**
- **Food chain**: Corn ‚Üí Flour ‚Üí Bread (easy to understand)
- **Metal chain**: Iron Ore ‚Üí Iron Plate ‚Üí Steel ‚Üí Construction Parts
- **Electronics**: Silicon ‚Üí Microchips ‚Üí Electronics (advanced)

### **Colors & Clarity**
- **High contrast**: Make sure text is readable
- **Consistent lighting**: Use same browser/OS theme for all shots
- **No dark mode**: Stick to light theme for consistency

## üìù File Naming

Save screenshots as:
- `objective-selection.png`
- `recipe-selection.png`
- `factory-canvas.png`
- `production-summary.png`
- `sharing.png`

Place them in: `screenshots/` folder (create if needed)

## üîÑ Updating Screenshots

When updating screenshots:
1. **Keep consistent style** - same browser, zoom, theme
2. **Update all at once** - maintain visual consistency
3. **Test on GitHub** - make sure they display properly
4. **Optimize file size** - use tools like TinyPNG

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Browser Setup**
- Use **Chrome** or **Edge** for consistent rendering
- **Disable extensions** that might interfere
- **Clear cache** for clean loading
- **Use incognito mode** to avoid personal data

### **Timing**
- Take screenshots when **animations are clear**
- **Wait for full loading** (no loading spinners)
- **Capture smooth connections** (particles flowing nicely)

### **Backup Plan**
If you can't take good screenshots:
- **Describe what you need** in an issue
- **Community can help** - others might have good setups
- **Use placeholders** temporarily with text descriptions
